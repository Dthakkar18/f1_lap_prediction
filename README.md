# Machine Learning Model for Lap Time Prediction

## Goal:
Build an ML model to predict lap times based on fuel load, tire wear, track temperature, and weather conditions.

## Process:
### Step 1: set up environment
### Step 2: load and prepare dataset
### Step 3: encode categorical variables and prepare for ML
### Step 4: train a machine learning model
### Step 5: evaluate preformance

## Dependencies:
- python 
- pandas 
- numpy
- scikit-learn 
- fastf1
- matplotlib
- seaborn
